    "I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me; had they duly considered how much depended upon what they were then doing;—that not only the production of a rational Being was concerned in it, but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body, perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind;—and, for aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost. Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and proceeded accordingly, I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world, from that, in which the reader is likely to see me.",
    
    "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. What matter where, if I be still the same, and what I should be? All is mine, and mine alone—wherever I dwell.",
    
    "I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught. The desire to learn is a gift, but the effort to learn can often be the struggle of the self against the conditions that bind it.",
    
    "Man is the only animal who can be bored. He is the only one who can know that time is moving. He is the only one who is aware of it, and yet finds the passage of it painful.",

    "The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and spending, we lay waste our powers. Little we see in Nature that is ours; we have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon, the winds that will be howling at all hours, and are up-gathered now, like sleeping flowers, for this, for everything, we are out of tune.",
    
    "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. It is better to be a lion for a day than a sheep for all your life. Courage isn't having the strength to go on—it is going on when you don't have strength.",
    
    "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.",
    
    "The only way to deal with this life meaningfully is to find one's passion and pursue it relentlessly. What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us."
